Project Navigator — From Ambiguous Idea to Shipped Product
Overview
Project Navigator is a hands-on product case study that demonstrates how I work as a Product Manager from problem discovery to a testable shipped solution.
This repository documents how I take an unclear, messy problem and turn it into:
a well-defined product opportunity,
a scoped and testable solution,
and a lightweight implementation that can be validated with users.
The goal is not polish — it’s clarity of thinking, decision-making, and execution.

Why I Built This
In my work across startups, consulting, and government projects, I’ve learned that strong product outcomes come from how problems are framed, not just how features are built.
I created Project Navigator to:
Show how I structure zero-to-one products
Make my product thinking visible (not just final outputs)
Give hiring managers a concrete example of how I work day-to-day
Practice disciplined product documentation and decision-making
This repo mirrors how I’d approach a real product inside a team.

Problem Context
Many teams jump into solutions too early:
unclear users,
vague success metrics,
oversized scopes,
and weak validation.
This project starts with a deliberately ambiguous product problem and shows how I progressively reduce uncertainty through research, prioritization, and iteration.

What’s Inside This Repo
01_problem-definition/
Problem statement and context
Target users and jobs-to-be-done
Key constraints (technical, business, time)
Clear success metrics and non-goals
I focus on defining the right problem before designing solutions.

02_research/
User interview notes (summarised and anonymised)
Secondary research and competitive scans
Assumptions and how they were validated or rejected
This section shows how I balance qualitative insight with speed and pragmatism.

03_prd/
Product goals and scope
Core user stories
Edge cases and failure scenarios
Non-functional requirements
The PRD is intentionally lean — enough to align execution without over-specifying.

04_design/
User flows
Low-fidelity wireframes
Key interaction decisions
Design here supports learning and alignment, not visual perfection.

05_implementation/
Simple prototype or mock interface
Demonstrates core user flow end-to-end
The goal is to make the product real enough to test.

06_learnings/
What worked
What didn’t
What I’d change in the next iteration
Open questions for further discovery
Reflection is treated as part of delivery, not an afterthought.

How to Review This Repo
If you’re evaluating me as a Product Manager:
Start with 01_problem-definition
Review 02_research to see how uncertainty was reduced
Read 03_prd to understand trade-offs and scope decisions
Skim design and implementation
End with 06_learnings for how I think about iteration
