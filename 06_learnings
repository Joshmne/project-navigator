Learnings – Underground Coal Mine Explosion Prediction Tool

What worked well
- Real data, real problem: Using actual underground coal mine sensor data made the project feel like a real safety product, not a toy ML demo.
- Clear problem framing: Starting from “predict dangerous methane levels and explosion risk” kept decisions focused on safety outcomes, not just model accuracy.
- Explainable approach: Correlation + regression made it easier to show why risk is increasing, which is important for engineers to trust the tool.
- Desktop workflow: Designing it as an installable desktop app that loads CSVs and outputs risk analysis fits how mining and safety teams already work.

Challenges & limitations
- Data generalisation: The datasets come from specific mines and time periods, so the model cannot be assumed to work for every mine without adaptation.
Complex environment: Explosions depend on many interacting factors, and a simple model will always miss some rare or edge cases.
- Thresholds are tricky: Setting what counts as “high risk” is a tradeoff between too many false alarms and missing real dangers.
- Trust & validation: For a safety‑critical tool, real mine safety teams would need deeper validation and testing before relying on it.

What I’d improve next
- Work with mine safety engineers to refine features, thresholds, and what “high risk” means in practice.
- Experiment with additional models (e.g. tree‑based or time‑series methods) but keep a strong focus on explainability.
- Improve the desktop UI with clearer guidance, better summaries per zone, and simple export/reporting for managers.
- Add stronger handling and warnings for missing sensors, bad data, or unusual conditions.

How this project reflects my product approach
- Start from a real, high‑stakes problem and user context, not from the algorithm.
- Use data and research to choose an approach that is both user-centric and explainable.
- Design the experience around how real engineers and operators will actually use the tool.
- Be explicit about limitations and treat this as a prototype step toward a more robust safety decision‑support system.
