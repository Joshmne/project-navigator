Implementation – Underground Coal Mine Explosion Prediction Tool

Tech stack
- Language: Python
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, Matplotlib/Seaborn
- Data: real underground coal mine sensor datasets (Lin Hua Mine + Mendeley methane dataset)

Model development process
1) Data loading and cleaning
- Load raw CSV files containing time‑stamped sensor readings from multiple devices.
- Handle missing values, obvious errors, and inconsistent units.
- Combine relevant columns into a single analysis dataset (e.g. methane concentration, airflow, temperature, pressure, equipment activity).

2) Feature selection and engineering
- Select variables that have a clear physical or empirical link to methane build‑up and explosion risk (e.g. gas content, wind speed, temperature, CO, sensor locations).
- Use correlation analysis to see which features are most strongly related to methane concentration and explosion danger.
- Drop clearly redundant or low‑value features so the model stays simple and explainable.

3) Normalisation
- Scale selected features to a common range (for example 0–1) so that variables with large numeric ranges do not dominate the model.
- Save the scaler configuration so the same transformation can be applied to new data.

4) Model training
- Split the dataset into training and test sets.
- Train a regression model (e.g. Linear Regression or a tree‑based model) to predict:
  - methane concentration, or
  - explosion danger degree
  from the selected features.
- Save the trained model for reuse inside the desktop application.

5) Evaluation
- Use Mean Squared Error (MSE) to measure the average difference between predicted and true values.
- Use R² score to measure how much of the variation in the target variable is explained by the model.
- Inspect residuals (errors) to see where the model performs poorly and in what conditions (e.g. certain zones or ranges) are hardest to predict.

6) Integration with the desktop app
- Wrap the trained model and preprocessing into functions that the desktop GUI can call after the user loads data.
- Connect the GUI flow to the model pipeline:
  - User imports data → data is cleaned and normalised
  - User runs analysis → model generates predictions
  - App displays risk scores and simple explanations based on model outputs.

Summary
The implementation combines real sensor data, a transparent regression‑based machine learning model, and a simple Python desktop interface. The goal is to give mine engineers a practical tool that predicts dangerous methane levels and explosion risk in time to support safer decisions, while keeping the pipeline reproducible and explainable.
